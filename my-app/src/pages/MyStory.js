<p class="story">It all started when I got bored with Smash Brothers and decided to take apart my GameCube (Sorry Santa) with a toolkit (Sorry Dad) as a kid.<br></br>

Little did I know that taking apart that gaming console would kickstart a wild ride into the world of technology and coding. 

<br></br>Life threw curveballs, though, and instead of pursuing these passions professionally,<br></br> I found myself working behind the scenes in the film industry and later, making a difference in the charity sector.<br></br>

I even thought stand-up comedy was my calling. <br></br>Yet after traveling the world, which gave me the courage to take the plunge and pursue that curiosity that got me<br></br> to open that GameCube all those years ago.<br></br>

Fast forward to the present, my coding journey found its home at the School of Code boot camp.<br></br> I took the plunge. Here, the amalgamation of my diverse experiences became apparent. <br></br>



The art of making people laugh through stand-up taught me the invaluable skill of connecting with diverse audiences. 
<br></br>The film industry, where I learned the art of storytelling, attention to detail, and the magic that happens when creativity meets technology.

<br></br> And then my charity background where I learned empathy and adaptability, <br></br>and the ability to work with purpose to make a differnce.
<br></br>So thank-you for visiting my portfolio and I hope we can build something cool together soon!</p>
