Thats why it was important that our MVP worked first before we moved onto stretch goals, to make sure we had a functioning app ready for deployment!"',

"Let me share the journey of creating 'Under the Weather' , my first exploration into APIs and DOM manipulation. <br>
</br> <br>
</br> • This app was my hands-on lesson on learning about APIs and dom manipulation.<br>
</br> <br>
</br> • Under the Weather' taught me to use the Fetch API, pulling real-time temperature data for any location. Learning asynchronous operations made the app stay lively and responsive while fetching data. <br></br>
<br></br>
• Then, DOM manipulation brought a visual twist. Clicks and inputs triggered instant updates, teaching me all about the importance of user interaction.
<br>
</br><br></br>

•Under the Weather' isn't cjust a weather app; it's my coding adventure. With every line of code, I discovered the thrill of bringing data to life and creating a personal user experience.
<br></br> <br></br>• This app is not just about weather updates; it's about embracing the excitement of learning and coding. Your weather updates, my way  all thanks to 'Under the Weather.'
