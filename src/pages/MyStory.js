  {/* <h1>It all started when I got bored with smash brothers <br></br> and decided to take  apart my <br></br> GameCube console as a kid....</h1>
  <h5>...My story began in the most unexpected place a Game Cube (Sorry Santa) <br></br> and a kid with a toolkit (Sorry Dad). Little did I know that <br></br> taking apart that gaming console would kickstart<br></br> a wild ride into the world of technology and coding. <br></br>
  Life threw curveballs though , and instead of persusing these passions profesionally, <br></br> I found myself working behind the scenes in the film industry, <br></br> and later, making a difference in the charity sector. 
  <br></br>I even thought stand up comedy was my calling yet, the dream of coding lingered, <br></br>patiently waiting for its turn on the stage. 
  After traveling the <br></br> world which gave me the courage to take the plunge and persue that curiosity <br></br>that got me to open that gameCube all those years ago.
  <br></br>Fast forward to the present  my coding journey found its home at the School of Code bootcamp. I took the plunge. <br></br> Here, the amalgamation of my diverse experiences became apparent. 
  <br></br>From comedy stages to charity initiatives, and film projects to lines of code, each chapter brought unique skills to the table.
  <br></br>The art of making people laugh through stand up taught me the invaluable skill of connecting with diverse audiences. <br>
  </br>The film industry where I learned the art of storytelling, attention to detail, and the magic that happens when creativity meets technology.  <br></br>
  </br>And thhen my charity background where i learnt empathy and adapdability  became my most potent tool, and the ability to work with purpose fueled my determination.
